- **Step 5**: 500 users for 10 minutes

### Stress Scenarios
- **Rapid Navigation**: Fast section switching
- **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple simultaneous requests
- **Resource Exhaustion**: High connection pooling
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Track degradation patterns

### Success Criteria
- 95th percentile response time < 10000ms

## 3. Spike Testing (spike-test.jmx)

### Objective
Validate system behavior during sudden traffic spikes and auto-scaling effectiveness.

### Test Configuration
```xml
Threads: 1000 users (sudden spike)
Ramp-up: 30 seconds
Duration: 15 minutes
Pattern: Immediate spike with sustain
Think Time: 0.1-0.5 seconds (very aggressive)
```

### Spike Pattern
- **Phase 1**: 10 users baseline (2 minutes)
- **Phase 2**: Spike to 500 users (30 seconds)
- **Phase 3**: Sustain 500 users (3 minutes)
- **Phase 4**: Spike to 1000 users (30 seconds)
- **Phase 5**: Sustain 1000 users (5 minutes)
- **Phase 6**: Recovery to 10 users (4 minutes)

### Spike Scenarios
- **Homepage Bombardment**: Concentrated homepage requests
